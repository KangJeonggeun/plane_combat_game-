This is the game that I learnt Python with.

I studied from the following great video and modified the game.

I added,
0.New designs for the planes and missiles.

1.character choice function
the player can choose the character he wants to play.

2.I resolved the problem that missiles instantly disappear when the enemy plane which lunched the missiles is eiminated.

3.I changed a lot of variable names while playing with the code, also some of structures of functions, classes,,

This was one of my first programms and I learnt a lot while playing with the code.
To run the program, you need to install the library Pygame. 
You can directly run the 8th file.
